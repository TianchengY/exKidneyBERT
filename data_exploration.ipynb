       "', MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION \\\\n Light Microscopy (LM):  The following LM findings are based on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), and Masson trichrome-stained sections.   The material submitted for LM contains two cores of almost all renal cortex.   More than 50 glomeruli are present for examination, of which 2 are globally sclerotic.   The non-sclerotic glomeruli appear immature and contain open capillary loops with no significant glomerulitis.   The capillary walls are of normal thickness and contours.   No significant mesangial matrix accumulation or mesangial hypercellularity is identified.   The tubulointerstitium is generally unremarkable with the tubules arranged in a back-to-back orientation.   No significant interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, tubular injury, interstitial edema, interstitial inflammation, or tubulitis is present.   No viral cytopathic changes are observed.   The arteries and arterioles are unremarkable.   No endotheliitis is present.   No significant peritubular capillaritis is identified.       Immunohistochemical (IHC) Stains:  IHC stains were performed and show the following:  - Polyomavirus (SV40): Negative.     Immunofluorescence (IF) Microscopy:  Frozen sections of the material submitted for IF contain renal cortical tissue with up to 6 glomeruli per section.   The IF stains show the following (in addition to internal positive control staining):  - C4d:  Negative in peritubular capillaries; trace internal positive control mesangial staining (0. 5+).   - IgG:  Negative.   - IgM:  Negative.   - IgA:  Negative.   - C3:  Negative.   - C1q:  Negative.   - Fibrinogen: Negative.   - Albumin: Negative.     Electron Microscopy (EM):  After reviewing the LM and IF material, it was determined that ultrastructural examination is not needed'"
